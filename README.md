Script that returns PestRoutes Sales leaderboard data

As a sales rep and developer, I was _so so so_ sad to learn that I couldn't get access to the FieldRoutes API. As a workaround, I went through the trouble of finding the endpoint that populates the PestRoutes Sales app's leaderboard, and wrote this script for easy access to it's data.
